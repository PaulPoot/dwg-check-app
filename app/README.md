# DWG Check App
This is a GitHub repository for a prototype app that allows the user to fill in checklists.

## Setting up
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal and enter `npm install -g cordova ionic` to globally install the latest Cordova and Ionic tools. Go grab a coffee.
3. Enter `npm install` to install required dependencies. Grab another coffee, you've got plenty of time.
4. Run `ionic serve --lab` to view the app in your browser.
